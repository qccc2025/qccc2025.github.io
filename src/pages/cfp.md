# Call for Papers

3rd International Conference on Quantum and Classical Computation and Complexity (QCCC 2025) will be held in Kazan, Russia, on June 21-23, 2025.
The conference is organized by the Kazan Federal University.
It continues the series of seminars co-located with the CSR and IQSA conferences and is the third in this series. The conference is hybrid (in-person and online), but in-person participation is preferred. 

# Principal Topics

Submissions concerning the quantum and classical computations and their complexity are invited for QCCC 2025. Original papers are sought in all aspects of quantum and classical computations and their complexity. Topics include, but are not limited to:

- quantum algorithms
- models of quantum computation
- classical and quantum complexity theory
- simulation of quantum systems
- classical and quantum communication
- quantum information theory
- classical and quantum machine learning
- data analysis on quantum computers
