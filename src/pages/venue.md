One of the charming landmarks on the campus of Kazan Federal University is the statue of the Learned Cat, a folklore figure in Russian culture. Originally an animal that could speak and tell stories, it was described in a poem by the Russian poet Pushkin. As one of the symbols of Kazan is Kazan cat, the statue of the Learned Cat was opened on the occasion of the KFU's birthday.
