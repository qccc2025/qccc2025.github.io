# Previous QCCC Events

The Conference on Quantum and Classical Computation and Complexity continues the series of workshops on "Computation and cryptography with qu-bits". 
- The first one was co-located with the Computer Science in Russia 2017 symposium.
- The second workshop was held in conjunction with the International Quantum Structures Association Conference.
Now these workshops have evolved into their own conference.
