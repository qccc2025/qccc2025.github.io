# Previous QCCC Events

The Conference on Quantum and Classical Computation and Complexity continues the series of workshops on "Computation and cryptography with qu-bits" associated with different conferences:
- co-located with the Computer Science in Russia 2010 symposium (proceedings: https://arxiv.org/html/1103.2268/);
- Parallel Computing Technologies (PaCT) 2011 conference (no proceedings);
- co-located with the Computer Science in Russia 2017 symposium (proceedings are a part of the special issue: https://link.springer.com/journal/12202/volumes-and-issues/39-7);
- held in conjunction with the International Quantum Structures Association Conference (no proceedings).

Now these workshops have evolved into their own conference. Since only two of the previous events had published proceedings, we count the QCCC 2025 as the third event in the series.
